# Web API with MongoDB

This repository contains my implementation of the [Web API with MongoDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mongo-app?view=aspnetcore-2.2&tabs=visual-studio) tutorial from the .net core 2.2 official documentation.

It's a simple REST API with CRUD capabilities, exposes the `api/books` resource, which is able to understand some HTTP verbs (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE`), and uses MongoDB as a data store.
